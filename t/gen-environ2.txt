Make bash script which does the following:
- if error occurs in script, print the location and exit immediately. use bash's internal mechanism.
- the script has ip_ns function which does ip netns exec command for given netns argument.
  This function is used by remaining portion.
- create a network namespaces named router.
  If that netns exists, start by deleting them.
- create two veth pairs:
  - client-veth0 and router-veth0
  - server-veth0 and router-veth1
- move router-veth0 and router-veth1 into router namespace
- set ip addresses of each interface
  : client-veth0 - 10.10.1.2/24
  : server-veth0 - 10.10.2.2/24 and 10.10.2.3/23
  : router-veth0 - 10.10.1.1/24
  : server-veth0 - 10.10.2.1/24
- up all generated interfaces.

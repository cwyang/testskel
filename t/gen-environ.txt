  The client veth interface name is veth0, and has IP address 10.10.1.2/24
  The router veth interface name is client-veth0, and has IP address 10.10.1.1/24

  The router veth interface name is server-veth0, and has IP address 10.10.2.1/24
  The server veth interface name is veth0, and has two IP addresses 10.10.2.2/24 and 10.10.2.3/24
